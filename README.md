# Jarvis - Under Development

Welcome to Jarvis, your personal assistant currently under development! This project integrates FlowGPT and PIAI to provide a powerful AI-driven experience. Jarvis is designed to respond to voice commands, waking up with a clap, and utilizing speech recognition and text-to-speech (TTS) functionalities.

## Features

- **FlowGPT Integration:** Jarvis leverages the capabilities of FlowGPT for natural language understanding and generation. This allows for intelligent conversations and responses.

- **PIAI Integration:** PIAI (Personal Intelligence Artificial Intelligence) is integrated to enhance Jarvis's ability to understand and adapt to user preferences and behavior.

- **Wake Up with Clap:** Jarvis responds to a clap, providing a hands-free way to wake up and interact with the assistant.

- **Speech Recognition:** Jarvis is equipped with speech recognition capabilities, allowing users to communicate with the assistant through voice commands.

- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Enjoy a natural and seamless interaction with Jarvis as it communicates back to you using text-to-speech synthesis.

- **Scrapping-based Brain:** Jarvis has its own brain built through web scraping, eliminating the need for external APIs and ensuring a self-contained and privacy-conscious assistant.
